# FileZorter
A visual file sorter for fast, minimal sorting, so as to prevent overwhelm. Sorting one file at a time quickly becomes easier than dealing with 100000 files at once.

Instructions
---
1. Point FileZorter to a directory (for example, "/home/user/Desktop") by entering that in the "current directory" box.
2. Decide what categories you want to organize into - for example, Videos, Pictures, Memes, Taxes, Tax Memes, etc. The names you choose will become folders created within your chosen directory. Enter them in the circle boxes around the center text, and you don't have to fill out all of them. You can just sort two categories if you want.
3. Press "connect" to link it. Now the folders are created from the names you entered in the boxes:
For example, if you fill box (7), (8), (9) with "Photos", "Videos", and "Documents", while your directory is "/home/user/Desktop", then when you press "connect", three folders with those names will be created within the desktop.
4. In the big box on the screen, you should see all files within your directory. The first file is likely selected. To sort that file, press the number of the box that you want to sort it into. In the earlier example, if you press 7, it will be sorted into "Photos", while if you press 9, it'll be in "Documents".
5. Enjoy a clean desktop (or whatever directory your chose)!

TODO:

1. Make it less buggy!
2. Though it isn't set up yet, I'm going to make it so that you can instead use the numpad so that it'll become muscle memory. Even just sorting 20 or so files will get the pattern within your mind! It's quite instinctive.
3. Write the rationale for why I decided sorting one file at a time is better. Essentially it's that it fixes overwhelm.
4. Make it so that the next file in the list is selected after sorting, instead of the first.
5. Make it so that you can use the up and down arrow keys to sort through the list (this is an easy fix!)
